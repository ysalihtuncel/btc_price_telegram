# BTC PRICE WITH TELEGRAM BOT
Sends BTC/USDT pair value with telegram bot using requests. You can change the pair.


To create a chatbot on Telegram, you need to contact the BotFather, which is essentially a bot used to create other bots.
The command you need is /newbot which leads to the following steps to create your bot:

Your bot should have two attributes: a name and a username. The name will show up for your bot, while the username will be used for mentions and sharing.

After choosing your bot name and username—which must end with “bot”—you will get a message containing your access token, and you’ll obviously need to save your access token and username for later, as you will be needing them.


After creating a chatbot change the telegram_bot_token with your token.
Invite @getidsbot or @RawDataBot to your group and get your group id from the chat id field then change your telegram_chat_id with your chat id.
